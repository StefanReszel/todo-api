This is typical CRUD project. It contains two applications: terminal interface and REST API which is used by.

## Technologies
<ul>
<li>Python 3.10</li>
<li>Flask</li>
<li>SQLAlchemy</li>

</ul>

## Usage
Clone the repository and change direction to `todo-api`:

Next step is installation of dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You should be able to run applications. First run REST API:
```
python run_todo_api.py
```
In a new terminal window run interface:
```
python run_todo_terminal.py
```
That's it, enjoy :)
